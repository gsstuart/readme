_What?  No code to look at?_

Most of my work has been proprietary, so at the moment there is not much to see here.

This repo has been used in the past to submit assignments for the Johns Hopkins/Coursera data science curriculum, so curious readers are invited to look at the below examples.  Although academic rather than professional, these files are the closest approximation to work samples publically available:

*Reproducible analysis of weather events in the United States, using NOAA weather data and the R programming language:*

*Reproducible analysis of fitness monitor data, using R:*
